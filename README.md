## Overview

This service provides AI-powered capabilities for {*insert product name here*}. It exposes a versioned REST API for easy integration and is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and reproducible.

**Key Features:**
*   *{Briefly list 2-3 key functionalities, e.g., "Real-time audio transcription"}*
*   *{e.g., "Conversational response generation"}*
*   *{e.g., "Vector-based document retrieval"}*

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Poetry (or `pip`)
*   Docker and Docker Compose
*   Access to {*mention any required databases or external services, e.g., MongoDB, Pinecone*}

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone {your-repo-url}
    cd {ai_service_name}
    ```

2.  **Set up local environment variables:**
    This project uses environment-specific `.env` files. For local development, copy the local template to a `.env` file, which `docker-compose.yml` will use by default.
    ```bash
    cp .env.local .env
    ```
    Now, open the `.env` file and fill in the required values.

3.  **Install dependencies (for IDE support):**
    While the service runs inside Docker, installing dependencies locally is recommended for IDE features like auto-completion.
    ```bash
    poetry install
    # OR
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to build the service and run it, along with any necessary local databases (e.g., a local MongoDB instance). This is the standard way to run the service for development.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The API documentation will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs/`.

### Running the API Server Manually

If you prefer to run the server directly on your host machine:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload```
```
### Running Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains standalone scripts for one-off tasks. To run them, execute them as Python modules.

```bash
# Example:
python scripts/data_ingestion.py --source ./data/raw/new_data.csv
```

## Folder Structure

This project follows a standardized folder structure to ensure consistency and maintainability across all AI services. Here's how to use it:

-   `configs/`
    -   **Purpose:** Stores all environment-specific configurations. `base.yaml` contains defaults, which are overridden by other files (`production.yaml`, etc.) for deployments.

-   `data/`
    -   **Purpose:** Contains sample data for local testing, evaluation sets, or schemas. Large files in this directory should be tracked with DVC.

-   `notebooks/`
    -   **Purpose:** For experimentation and exploratory analysis only. Code in this folder **must not** be part of the production application.

-   `scripts/`
    -   **Purpose:** Place one-off, executable scripts here. Good for tasks like database migrations or running a model evaluation.

-   `src/{ai_service_name}/`
    -   **Purpose:** This is the core, installable Python package for the service. All production logic lives here. The `__init__.py` files mark these directories as Python packages.
    -   `api/`: Contains all web-related code.
        -   `v1/`: A versioned module for the API. `endpoints.py` defines API routes, and `schemas.py` defines the Pydantic data contracts.
        -   `main.py`: Instantiates the main FastAPI application and includes the versioned API routers.
    -   `db/`: Handles all database interactions. `connection.py` manages connection pools, and `repository.py` contains functions to read/write to your databases (NoSQL, Vector DB, etc.).
    -   `components/`: Contains reusable, standalone ML building blocks (e.g., `web_scraper.py`, `audio_processor.py`). These should be testable in isolation.
    -   `pipeline/`: This is where you orchestrate the components into end-to-end workflows. `prediction_pipeline.py` defines the step-by-step logic for an inference request.
    -   `prompts.py`: Centralizes all LLM prompt templates.
    -   `utils.py`: Holds shared helper functions, like custom loggers.

-   `tests/`
    -   **Purpose:** All unit and integration tests go here. The file structure should mirror the `src/` structure.

-   `.env.*` Files
    -   **Purpose:** These files manage environment variables for different deployment stages (`local`, `staging`, `production`). **Never commit secrets to these files.** They should be populated by the CI/CD system.

-   `docker-compose.yml`
    -   **Purpose:** Defines the local development environment, allowing you to spin up the AI service and its dependencies (like databases) with a single command.

-   `Dockerfile`
    -   **Purpose:** Defines the instructions to build the final, optimized Docker image for production deployment.

-   `main.py`
    -   **Purpose:** The root entry point used by Uvicorn to start the application server. It should remain minimal.

## Testing

To run the full suite of tests for this service:

```bash
pytest
```

## Deployment

This service is deployed as a Docker container. The CI/CD pipeline in `.github/workflows/main.yml` automatically builds and pushes the image to our container registry when code is merged into the `main` branch.
